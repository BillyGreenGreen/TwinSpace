# Twin Time
A small 2D bullet hell game made with Unity.

The premise of the game is to collect orbs from different coloured enemies and deposit then into the corresponding black holes within the center of the arena, the slimes get harder to kill as the game progresses and you can choose and array of power-ups to aid you in killing them.
